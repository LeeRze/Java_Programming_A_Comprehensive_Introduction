JDK 7 adds a new method to File called toPath(), which is shown here:
  Path toPath()

toPath returns a Path object that represents the file encapsulated by the invoking File object.
(In other words, toPath() converts a File into a Path) (toPath forms a bridge between the File class and the new Path interface)

Table: A Sampling of Utility Methods Provided by File.

Method,  Description

boolean delete(),  Deletes the file specified by the invoking object. Returns true if the file was deleted and false if the file cannot be removed

void deleteOnExit(),  Removes the file associated with the invoking object when the Java Virtual Machine terminates.

long getFreeSpace(),  Returns the number of free bytes of storage available on the partition associated with invoking object.

long getTotalSpace(),  Returns the storage capacity of the partition asscociated with the invoking object.

long getUsableSpace(),  Returns the number of usable free bytes of storage available on the partition associated with the invoking object.

long lastModified(),  Obtains the time stamp on the invoking file. The value returned is the number of milliseconds from January 1, 1970,
                      Coordinated Universal Time(UTC). If no time stamp is available, zero is returned.

boolean mkdir(),  Creates the directory specified by the invoking object. Return true if the directory was created and false if the directory
                  could not be created. Failure can occur for various reasons, such as the path specified in the File object already exists, or
                  the directory cannot be created because the entire path does not exist yet.

boolean mkdirs(),  Creates the directory and all required parent directories specified by the invoking object. Return true if the entire path
                   was created and false otherwise.

boolean renameTo(File newName),  Renames the file specified by the invoking object to newName. Returns true if successful and false if the file
                                 cannot be renamed.

boolean setLastModified(long millisec),  Sets the time stamp on the invoking file to that specified by millisec, which is milliseconds from UTC.

boolean setReadOnly(),  Sets the file to read-only.

boolean setWritable(boolean how),  If how is true, the file is set to writable. If how is false, the file is set to read-only.
                                   Returns true if the status of the file was modified and false if the write status cannot be changed.
