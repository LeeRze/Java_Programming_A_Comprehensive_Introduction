Table: The Methods Defined by Writer

Method, Description

Writer append(char ch),  Appends ch to the end of the invoking output stream. Returns a reference to the invoking stream.

Writer append(CharSequence chars),  
                      Appends chars to the end of the invoking output stream. Returns a reference to the invoking stream.
                      CharSequence is an interface that defines read-only operations on a sequence of characters.

Writer append(CharSequence chars, int begin, int end),
                      Appends the sequence of chars starting at begin and stopping with end to the end of the invoking output
                      stream. Returns a reference to the invoking stream. CharSequence is an interface that defines read-only
                      operations on a sequence of characters.

abstract void close(),  Closes the output stream. Further write attempts will generate an IOException.

abstarct void flush(),  Causes any output that has been buffered to be sent to its destination. That is, it flushes the output buffer.

void write(int ch),  Writes a single character to the invoking output stream. Note that the parameter is an int, which
                     allows you to call write() with expressions without having to cast them back to char.

void write(char[] buffer),  Writes a complete array of characters to the invoking output stream.

abstarct void write(char[] buffer, int offset, int numChars),
                        Writes a subrange of numChars characters from the array buffer, beginning at buffer[offset] to the invoking output stream.

void write(String str),  Writes str to the invoking output stream.

void write(String str, int offset, int numChars), 
                         Writes a subrange of numChars characters from the array str, beginning at the specified offset.
