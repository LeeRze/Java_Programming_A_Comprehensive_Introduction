Byte streams are defined by using two class hierarchies.
At the top of these are two abstract classes:

InputStream and OutputStream

Inputstream defines the characteristics common to byte input streams
Outputstream describes the behavior of byte output streams.


Table:

Byte_Stream_Class, Meaning

BufferedInputStream, Buffered input stream
BufferedOutputStream, Buffered output stream

ByteArrayInputStream, Input stream that reads from a byte array
ByteArrayOutputStream, Output stream that writes to a byte array

DataInputStream, An input stream that contains methods for reading the primitive data types
DataOutputStream, An output stream that contains methods for writing the primitive data types

FileInputStream, Input stream that reads from a file
FileOutputStream, Output stream that writes to a file

FilterInputStream, Filtered InputStream
FilterOutputStream, Filtered OutputStream

InputStream, Abstract class that describes stream input

ObjectInputStream, Input stream for objects
ObjectOutputStream, Output stream for objects

OutputStream, Abstract class that describes stream output

PipedInputStream, Input pipe
PipedOutputStream, Output pipe

PrintStream, Output stream that contains print() and println()

PushbackInputStream, Input stream that allows bytes to be returned to the stream

SequenceInputStream, Input stream that is a combination of two or more input streams that will be read sequentially, one after the other
